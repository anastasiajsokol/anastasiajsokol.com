        <h2>Document's Intended Audience</h2>

        <p>
            This style was made by me, Anastasia, for me, Anastasia. Anyone is
            absolutely free to link to this style if they so wish, but I would
            perhaps stronly urge against it. First of all, I am a fool. I live
            within a realm of jest in which I pretend to know what I am doing.
            I do not. I have the artistic talent of a rock that has spent all
            too long tumbling in a stream only to be left featureless and
            smooth. As you can see, I think a centered page with margins (which
            I may add serve no purpose whatsoever) is peak design. Secondly, I
            make no promises that this will remain constant. If you are okay
            with the style of your page changing over time (SOMETIMES IN WAYS
            THAT MAY WELL BREAK THE SYMANTIC LAYOUT TOO!) then linking is fine.
            I may even improve the style over time (I jest yet again). But, if
            you want it to just work and continue working then I recommend
            hosting a copy of any styles somewhere else.

        <h2>Page Layout</h2>

        <p>
            At the highest level, each page should be made up of two kinds of
            tags. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag should be used for the
            title and any navigation elements. This can be followed by any
            number of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags which contain the page
            content (such as this). Every page should contain at least one
            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag, both because a page without any
            content has no reason to exist and because the styling depends a
            bit on that being that case.
        </p>

        <p>
            While spacing should not usually be manually added or considered, it
            may be useful to note that the very first element (which should
            generally be a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> but may be anything) will
            recieve extra padding on the top, and the very last
            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> will both recieve extra padding on the
            bottom and be stretched to fill the full page height if the content
            itself does not take up the full view height.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many pages have some kind of title. Generally this should be placed
            within a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and be a <code>h1#title</code>
            tag. After the title I am partial to placing a horizontal divider
            (<code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code>) to get into the page content. If your
            page needs navigation there are two standard options. Naturally a
            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag should come first. Then two kinds of
            navigation are available.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Ordered navigation (that is, breadcrumbs)</li>
            <li>Unordered navigation (that is, site pages)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These can be formed using the appropriate list tags with links
            placed within them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moving into the section (or sections) of the page, these are for
            general page content. If the page content is largely text (such as
            this) or otherwise split into neat sections (often the case) then
            you can use <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags for each subheader. Text
            should then be formed into paragraphs, each paragraph containing a
            single idea (yada yada). Within your HTML itself, long lines of
            text within a paragraph should still fit within 80 characters (this
            includes indentation for other elements). You can add arbitrary
            line breaks without changing the way that the text is rendered. In
            any cases where this is not possible, for example an inline link
            which takes up more than the available space, put that element all
            on one line by itself within the markup.

        <h2>Variables</h2>

        <p>
            I absolutely love CSS variables, perhaps a little too much. But they
            can be used to change elements about the page style without causing
            too much of a mess. Any you can change them programmatically!
        </p>

        <p>
            Up first we have the colors. These are not used directly, per se,
            but do show up within the definitions of other variables so that
            some colors can be consistent across uses. They consist of
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="var" var="deep-black">deep-black</li>
            <li class="var" var="orange">orange</li>
            <li class="var" var="white">white</li>
            <li class="var" var="black">black</li>
            <li class="var" var="grey">grey</li>
            <li class="var" var="pink">pink</li>
            <li class="var" var="wine">wine</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Then there are a number of sementic colors. These do not refer to
            any specific color, but use the defined color to define how parts
            of the page should be colored. They consist of
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="var" var="background-color">background-color</li>
            <li class="var" var="foreground-color">foreground-color</li>
            <li class="var" var="inset-color">inset-color</li>
            <li class="var" var="emphasis-text-color">emphasis-text-color</li>
            <li class="var" var="default-text-color">defualt-text-color</li>
            <li class="var" var="dark-text-color">dark-text-color</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Font variables are a bit limited in scope but may also be used to
            change the appearence of the page. Currently the offerings are
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="var" var="default-text-font">default-text-font</li>
            <li class="var" var="title-text-font">title-text-font</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There will probably be a new variable for code and other monospace
            (or visual text, like emoticons) coming soon.
        </p>

        <p>
            And last but not least are the spacing variables. These are
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="var" var="content-width-limit">content-width-limit</li>
            <li class="var" var="page-margin">page-margin</li>
            <li class="var" var="paragraph-spacing">paragraph-spacing</li>
            <li class="var" var="spacing">spacing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The most important of these is arguably <code>spacing</code> which
            controls the general density of the page as a whole. It shows up
            everywhere, and while I recognize that more fine tuned spacing
            could be useful, I personally like it when things like padding and
            margins between elements are somewhat consistent.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Special Elements &amp; Styles</h2>

        <p>
            These are miscellaneous items that may be used to provide somewhat
            consistent components across pages.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <span class="strike">strike</span> class can be added to mark
            text as removed for some reason that retains value in still being a
            part of the document. Keep in mind that by default this will still
            be picked up by screen readers and text-based views of the page, so
            do not necessarily depend on it to convery meaning. For links it is
            better to use the <a href="#inactive" class="inactive">inactive</a>
            class. Partially because it also changes the color, but also so that
            the symantic meaning of the page is perserved.
        </p>

        <div class="breakout">
            <h3>Breakout Boxes</h3>

            <p>
                Breakout boxes can be used to create seperate (though hopefully
                related) content in context to a page or surrounding text. The
                recommended structure is to use a <code>div.breakout</code> tag,
                then within that place a <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tag for the
                title and finally paragraphs for text. The title can be omitted
                if not required within a given context.
