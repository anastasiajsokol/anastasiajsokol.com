        <h2>Document's Intended Audience</h2>

        <p>
            This style was made by me, Anastasia, for me, Anastasia. Anyone is
            absolutely free to link to this style if they so wish, but I would
            perhaps stronly urge against it. First of all, I am a fool. I live
            within a realm of jest in which I pretend to know what I am doing.
            I do not. I have the artistic talent of a rock that has spent all
            too long tumbling in a stream only to be left featureless and
            smooth. As you can see, I think a centered page with margins (which
            I may add serve no purpose whatsoever) is peak design. Secondly, I
            make no promises that this will remain constant. If you are okay
            with the style of your page changing over time (SOMETIMES IN WAYS
            THAT MAY WELL BREAK THE SYMANTIC LAYOUT TOO!) then linking is fine.
            I may even improve the style over time (I jest yet again). But, if
            you want it to just work and continue working then I recommend
            hosting a copy of any styles somewhere else.
        </p>

        <h2>Page Layout</h2>

        <p>
            At the highest level, each page should be made up of three kinds of
            tags. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag should be used for the
            title and any navigation elements. This can be followed by any
            number of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags which contain the page
            content (such as this). And finally a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>
            tag may be placed at the very end.
        </p>

        <p>
            While spacing should not usually be manually added or considered, it
            may be useful to note that the very first element (which should
            generally be a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> but may be anything) will
            recieve extra padding on the top, and the very last element (which
            may again be anything) will both recieve extra padding on the bottom
            and be stretched to fill the full page height if the content itself
            does not take up the full view height.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many pages have some kind of title. Generally this should be placed
            within a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and be a <code>h1#title</code>
            tag. After the title I am partial to placing a horizontal divider
            (<code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code>) to get into the page content. If your
            page needs navigation there are two standard options. Naturally a
            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag should come first. Then two kinds of
            navigation are available.
        
            <ul>
                <li>Ordered navigation (id est breadcrumbs)</li>
                <li>Unordered navigation (id est site pages)</li>
            </ul>

            These can be formed using the appropriate list tags with links
            placed within them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moving into the section (or sections) of the page, these are for
            general page content. If the page content is largely text (such as
            this) or otherwise split into neat sections (often the case) then
            you can use <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags for each subheader. Text
            should then be formed into paragraphs, each paragraph containing a
            single idea (yada yada). Within your HTML itself, long lines of
            text within a paragraph should still fit within 80 characters (this
            includes indentation for other elements). You can add arbitrary
            line breaks without changing the way that the text is rendered. In
            any cases where this is not possible, for example an inline link
            which takes up more than the available space, put that element all
            on one line by itself within the markup.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not every page needs a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, in fact most do
            not in my opinion, but if you do have a usecase where a footer makes
            sense then you can simply put the tag at the end of the document
            and it should "just work." Since I do not consistently have use for
            them there is currently no footer-specific styling (like laying
            out links into columns) but this may come in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Variables</h2>

        <p>
            I absolutely love CSS variables, perhaps a little too much. But they
            can be used to change elements about the page style without causing
            too much of a mess. Any you can change them programmatically!
        </p>

        <p>
            Up first we have the colors. These are not used directly, per se,
            but do show up within the definitions of other variables so that
            some colors can be consistent across uses. They consist of

            <ul>
                <li class="var" var="deep-black">deep-black</li>
                <li class="var" var="orange">orange</li>
                <li class="var" var="white">white</li>
                <li class="var" var="black">black</li>
                <li class="var" var="grey">grey</li>
                <li class="var" var="pink">pink</li>
                <li class="var" var="wine">wine</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Then there are a number of sementic colors. These do not refer to
            any specific color, but use the defined color to define how parts
            of the page should be colored. They consist of

            <ul>
                <li class="var" var="background-color">background-color</li>
                <li class="var" var="foreground-color">foreground-color</li>
                <li class="var" var="inset-color">inset-color</li>
                <li class="var" var="emphasis-text-color">emphasis-text-color</li>
                <li class="var" var="default-text-color">defualt-text-color</li>
                <li class="var" var="dark-text-color">dark-text-color</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Font variables are a bit limited in scope but may also be used to
            change the appearence of the page. Currently the offerings are

            <ul>
                <li class="var" var="default-text-font">default-text-font</li>
                <li class="var" var="title-text-font">title-text-font</li>
            </ul>

            There will probably be a new variable for code and other monospace
            (or visual text, like emoticons) coming soon.
        </p>

        <p>
            And last but not least are the spacing variables. These are

            <ul>
                <li class="var" var="content-width-limit">content-width-limit</li>
                <li class="var" var="page-margin">page-margin</li>
                <li class="var" var="paragraph-spacing">paragraph-spacing</li>
                <li class="var" var="spacing">spacing</li>
            </ul>

            The most important of these is arguably <code>spacing</code> which
            controls the general density of the page as a whole. It shows up
            everywhere, and while I recognize that more fine tuned spacing
            could be useful, I personally like it when things like padding and
            margins between elements are somewhat consistent.
