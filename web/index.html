                    Yay I am so glad you are here! My name is Anastasia or Ana
                    for short. I am <span id="age">an age</span> at the moment,
                    which is really no time at all while also my whole life...
                    This page is still a bit of a mess, and likely will be for
                    a long time, but so am I so maybe it is really just peak
                    design <span class="emoticon">:3</span> Currently I am
                    studying computer science at Colorado School of Mines, and
                    will hopefully start working towards a masters in STEM
                    education with a focus in computer science next semester!
                    (I still need to be approved, but it should work out) Aside
                    from computer science and education I have a bunch of random
                    hobbies. Some of my favorites are hiking, backpacking,
                    anything at all related to snow, cooking, book binding,
                    reading fiction, and journaling. Really though those are
                    all the same thing in a convoluted sort of way. Like
                    everything in life, hobbies are best with other people, so
                    if you ever want to talk about one of the hobbies I have (or
                    even better a hobby you have that I do not) please
                    absolutely feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me!</a>
                </p>

                    const year = 2005; const month = 8; const day = 26;

                    // how does that compare to now?
                    // I am going to assume that your time zone is accurate
                    // this matches how I personally celebrate my birthday too!

                    const age = now.getUTCFullYear() - year - !happened;

            <h2>About This Website</h2>

            <p>
                I am hardly a web design expert, nor do I have good taste,
                however neither of those two things stop me from having strong
                opinions about what I want my website to look like and more
                importantly feel like. At this point you are probably thinking
                that you should just skip this section, and I think you may be
                right lest you fall into reading my poorly founded opinions
                mwahahaha!
            </p>

            <p>(ok ok but this will come later... so you win for now...)</p>
