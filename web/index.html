                    Yay I am so glad you are here! My name is Anastasia or Ana
                    for short. This page is still a bit of a mess, and likely
                    will be for a long time, but so am I so maybe it is really
                    just peak design <span class="emoticon">:3</span> Currently
                    I am studying computer science at Colorado School of Mines,
                    and will hopefully start working towards a masters in STEM
                    education with a focus in computer science next semester!
                    (I still need to be approved, but it should work out) Aside
                    from computer science and education I have a bunch of random
                    hobbies. Some of my favorites are hiking, backpacking,
                    anything at all related to snow, cooking, book binding,
                    reading fiction, and journaling. Really though those are
                    all the same thing in a convoluted sort of way. Like
                    everything in life, hobbies are best with other people, so
                    if you ever want to talk about one of the hobbies I have (or
                    even better a hobby you have that I do not) please
                    absolutely feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me!</a>
