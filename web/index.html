                <p>
                    Yay I am so glad you are here! My name is Anastasia or Ana
                    for short. I am <span id="age">an age</span> at the moment,
                    which is really no time at all while also my whole life...
                    This page is still a bit of a mess, and likely will be for
                    a long time, but so am I so maybe it is really just peak
                    design <code>:3</code> Currently I am studying computer
                    science at Colorado School of Mines. I plan on graduating
                    with my bachlor's degree next May and then starting a
                    master's degree next August (hopefully I am accepted). Aside
                    from computer science and education I have a bunch of random
                    hobbies. Some of my favorites are hiking, backpacking,
                    anything at all related to snow, cooking, book binding,
                    reading fiction, and journaling. Really though those are
                    all the same thing in a convoluted sort of way. Like
                    everything in life, hobbies are best with other people, so
                    if you ever want to talk about one of the hobbies I have (or
                    even better a hobby you have that I do not) please
                    absolutely feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me!</a>

            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            
            <p>
                As alluded to above this site is a bit of a mess. It is
                ultimately the home of various projects I wanted to put
                publically onto the internet in some form. Many sections are
                currently still under construction &mdash; some are even lacking
                in any substantive content &mdash; but feel free to explore if
                anything catches your interest.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have many opinions about what digital content is appealing and
                effective for me personally. Not all of them are well founded or
                strictly speaking "good" at being effective methods of
                communication. That being said, if you are curious about why
                this page and many of the other pages on this site look the way
                they do (and how you could &mdash; though should not &mdash;
                have a similar site) check out my
                <a href="//style.anastasiajsokol.com/">style document</a>.

            <h2>Things That Exist Online</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">Grant Sanderson's 3B1B</a></p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I absolutely love what Grant Sanderson is doing with mathematics
                        education (and technical education more broadly) with videos on
                        motivated intuitions behind otherwise potentially quite hard to
                        grasp topics. The Manim python library along with the community
                        around it is also yet another sign that what he is doing is not
                        just amazing in its own right but has real potential to be the
                        basis for lots of new amazing educational content on the web!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Also he got me out of calculus one &mdash; just in case I needed
                        any more reasons to be in awe of the project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another person who I believe is doing some incredible things on
                        the internet. I love all of her videos so much, but her passion
                        for education is especially heartwarming and inspiring to me. I
                        sincerely believe that some of the videos on her channel have
                        made me a better person after some reflection and that is always
                        a good thing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Also her cat is so cute and shows up in many videos which...
                        it just adds that much more. From her current page description:
                        <i>The cat is the brains of the operation.</i>
                    </p>
