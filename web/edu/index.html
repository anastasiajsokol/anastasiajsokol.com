        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>
            This is the page (or collection of pages) I am most excited about
            within the entire website! There are currently only a few published
            topics (all listed above) but hopefully more will be coming soon.
            The short-term trajectory of this site is aimed at covering small,
            primarily stand-alone, topics that can help build understanding if
            they are encountered somewhere else. Some will be general overviews
            of a topic, useful if that aligns with a specfic goal. Others are
            planned to be iteratively deeper looks into a topic, useful if the
            goal is to build more robust general knowledge. The long-term vision
            is to eventually cover enough topics to start building meaningful
            interrelated context around the topics themselves. Some will
            inevitably remain just tiny peeks into something specific, but
            others could be organized into groups, guides, and finally courses.
        </p>

            Please feel free to propose topics you want to see here, give
            recommendations on how to further evolve the site, or tell me about
            all the things I got wrong via my
