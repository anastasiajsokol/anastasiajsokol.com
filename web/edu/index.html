        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>
            This is the page (or collection of pages) I am most excited about
            within the entire website! There are (currently) two main sections.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Algorithm Library</p>
                <p>
                    Here you can find descriptions, implementations, and
                    analyses of algorithms that I find particularly interesting.
                    In general, as the name of the page would imply, this
                    content is intended to be useful as a pedagogical resource.
                    That being said, the exact focus placed on a given algorithm
                    may or may not align with how a specific course may want to
                    focus on it.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Special Topics</p>

                <p>
                    While my primary focus is computer science &mdash; and
                    probably will remain so into the future &mdash; some content
                    does not quite fall within the scope of what could arguably
                    be called an algorithm. Those topics will be put onto the
                    special topics page.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Courses</p>
                <p>
                    As I learn more about designing courses I will start
                    creating some course content &mdash; and eventually entire
                    courses &mdash; then putting that content under the courses
                    page. For now no course is anywhere near complete enough to
                    be worth uploading, so this page is inactive. I do not
                    recommend using content placed there at face value. I
                    currently <em>do not</em> have a degree in education.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Usage, Linking, and Citation</h2>

        <p>
            Check back later for my guidelines. Generally, you are okay to do
            whatever you want, but there may be some specific restrictions in
            the future, and maybe more importantly information on how to link
            to content depending on your use case.
