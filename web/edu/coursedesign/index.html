            My own thoughts mixed in with the thoughts of people who actually
            have the qualifications to have opinions. This is mostly a reference
            to use to guide designing other materials within the educational
            resources section of my page. It is worth noting that while I will
            try to site everything whenever possible, my opinions do not come
            from nowhere however may also not have a clear origin in which case
            since this page is really just an amalgamation of my own hubris I
            may not put in the work to back everything up (at least to begin
            with while I am just trying to get this off the ground).
