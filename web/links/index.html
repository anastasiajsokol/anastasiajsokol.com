        <p>Sadly I am not currently a part of any webrings... working on it!</p>

        <h2>Things That Exist</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">Grant Sanderson's 3B1B</a></li>

            <p>
                I absolutely love what Grant Sanderson is doing with mathematics
                education (and technical education more broadly) with videos on
                motivated intuitions behind otherwise potentially quite hard to
                grasp topics. The Manim python library along with the community
                around it is also yet another sign that what he is doing is not
                just amazing in its own right but has real potential to be the
                basis for lots of new amazing educational content on the web!
            </p>

            <p>
                Also he got me out of calculus one &mdash; just in case I needed
                any more reasons to be in awe of the project.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another person who I believe is doing some incredible things on
                the internet. I love all of her videos so much, but her passion
                for education is especially heartwarming and inspiring to me. I
                sincerely believe that some of the videos on her channel have
                made me a better person after some reflection and that is always
                a good thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also her cat is so cute and shows up in many videos which...
                it just adds that much more. From her current page description:
                <i>The cat is the brains of the operation.</i>
