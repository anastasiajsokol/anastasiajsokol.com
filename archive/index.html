        <h2>About the Archive</h2>

        <p>
            The need for permanent links is self-evident. When a site links to
            another there is nothing keeping that content stable, leading to the
            all too common phenomena of link rot. At the same time, the desire
            may arise to have content change. For example a linked page about a
            specific algorithm may be updated to fix issues, add new resources,
            or offer alternative viewpoints.
        </p>

        <p>
            This archive seeks to meet both needs poorly. By providing links
            that will last for as long as this page exists to static forms of a
            specific page links can be made that will not change (to the extent
            plausible) for (hopefully) my lifetime. The original link &mdash;
            which is now free to remain plastic &mdash; may remain unchanged, be
            updated with new content, or rot away entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
            All that being said, while this page should be a valuable resource
            in temporarily preventing link rot it is not a replacement for more
            permanent archives. If it is crucial that content remains static for
            as long as resonably possible consider archiving this link within
            the <a href="//archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> or similar such
            site.

        <h2>Downloading or Mirroring the Archive</h2>

        <p>
            I want to make this possible in the future, however currently I do
            not have any mechanisms in place for this. Generally, please feel
            free to mirror content within the archive without modification for
            any educational or otherwise non-commercial use. In the future these
            restrictions may change to be more allowing.
