        <h2>Why Have a Javascript CDN?</h2>

        <p>
            I dislike depending on other websites to provide javascript content
            that is essential to the operation of a page itself. The difference
            between the CDN section of the archive and the core archive itself
            is that the CDN section is hosting primarily content that
            <em>is not</em> in any way owned by me (Anastasia).
        </p>

        <p>
            Also the naming scheme is different to allow for both the origin and
            the content of the files to be more clear from the URL itself. This
            makes it easier to link to within page content in a way that will
            not be aggravating to me.
